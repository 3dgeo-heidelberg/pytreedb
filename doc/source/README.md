# Introduction to pytreedb

`pytreedb` is a üêç Python software package providing an object-based library to provide a simple database interface and REST API of vegetation tree objects that were captured as 3D point clouds. The main objective is to provide a Python library for the storage and sharing of single tree-based point clouds and all relevant (forest intentory) tree measurements. The tree data include all tree related information, measurements, metadata, geoinformation and also links to the 3D point clouds linked in any file format (e.g. LAS/LAZ). `GeoJSON` including all tree-related information is used as data format  for data exchange and visualization with other software (e.g. direct import into most GIS). Thereby view and modification of the tree datasets (*.geojson) is straightforward.

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is used as database backend via the [PyMongo](https://pypi.org/project/pymongo/) driver. This enables scaling to large global datasets, e.g. connecting to [MongoDB Atlas Cloud](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for big datasets. Working only locally using a local MongoDB installation is also possible, if the database is only needed during runtime of data processing and sharing on the Web is not required.

## Main Features

`pytreedb` has three main components and usage directions:
1. **Python library**: In case you need to access the tree database in your Python scripts during runtime of data processing and analysis. 
2. **REST API**: In case you want to provide your datasets to any software over a REST API. The `pytreedb` server application is using the [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) framework.
3. **Web frontend**: In case you want to share your valuable tree data to the community. Based on the REST API we showcase in this repository how a Web frontend can be easily implemented, which provides several query options, data export and also map views of query results.

The main components and design of `pytreedb` are shown in this figure:
